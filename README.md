# 📜 License Agreements on Chain

## 📝 Project Description
License Agreements on Chain is a smart contract solution to securely store and manage licensing agreements directly on the blockchain. It allows licensors and licensees to register and retrieve immutable agreements via IPFS hashes, ensuring transparency and authenticity.

## 🌐 Project Vision
The vision is to create a decentralized and tamper-proof system for recording license agreements that can be independently verified without relying on intermediaries or central authorities.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Immutable Records**: Each license agreement is permanently recorded with timestamp and involved parties.
- **IPFS Integration**: Agreements are stored off-chain on IPFS, while their reference hashes are anchored on-chain.
- **Transparency & Trust**: Enables public verification of licenses, increasing trust and reducing disputes.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Add signature verification to confirm both parties' consent.
- Enable revocation or expiration tracking of licenses.
- Integrate user interfaces for licensors/licensees to manage licenses easily.
- Expand to support different types of licenses (e.g., software, content, patents).
